Hi, my name is [Da Kuang](https://kuangda.tech/), a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/), University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Junhyong Kim](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/).

This is a Single-cell Genomic Reading List to take notes on the papers I encountered while learning computational biology. I am a computer science student therefore the list tends to focus on Algorithm and Statistical Inference.

Now the reading list is powered by Obsidian and can be accessed from here: https://publish.obsidian.md/single-cell-papers/

Also, this reading list is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuang-da/scGenomic-Reading-List). Feel free to star or fork it if you find it interesting. Pull requests and issues will be appreciated. Thanks!
